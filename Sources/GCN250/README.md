# GCN250
GCN250 is the global gridded curve numbers data at a spatial resolution of 250m. Curve Numbers are fundamental in rainfall-runoff modelling. The potential application of this data includes hydrologic design, land management applications, flood risk assessment, and groundwater recharge modeling. 

Dataset is sourced from the [Google Earth Engine Community Catalogue](https://gee-community-catalog.org/projects/gcn250/)

You can also visualise this dataset using this [Google Earth Engine App](https://jaafarhadi.users.earthengine.app/view/hydrologic-curve-number) created by the authors of the dataset.


**Variables extracted from the source:** 

1. `mean_cn`: Mean curve numbers help in estimation of Surface runoff
