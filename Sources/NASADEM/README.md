**Variables extracted from the source:** `Elevation` and `Slope`

**Time Taken to run the script:** ~3 hours at 30m scale.

## Project Structure
- `scripts` : Contains the scripts used to obtain the data
    - `nasadem.py`: Exports the DEM and Slope files into Google Drive
    - `gdrive.py`: Downloads the DEM and Slope files from Google Drive to server
    - `transformer.py`: Calculates the mean `elevation` and `slope` for each sub-district in Odisha. 
- `data`: Contains datasets generated using the scripts
